Hangman game for Popular Art appreciation
============================================

As course project for **ART406A course at IIT Kanpur** under **prof. Shatarupa T. Roy**. Through this fun game we aim to introduce the paintings and art-works of **Salvador Dali** and **Pablo Picasso** to school children. 


The Salvador Dali Hangman Game
-----------------------------------
Salvador Dali will show you one of his paintings or a photograph and you need to guess the word that best describes it (in some cases it may be two words). The answers may include a part of the painting's title, or simply a descriptive word of what you see in the art. But as Salvador Dali sits there next to his painting, if you choose a wrong letter, you'll see Dali express his displeasure with your mistakes ... if you make six wrong choices, Dali will let you know that the game is over.

The Pablo Picasso Hangman Game
-----------------------------------
Pablo Picasso will show you one of his paintings or a photograph and you need to guess the word that best describes it (in some cases it may be two words). The answers may include a part of the painting's title, or simply a descriptive word of what you see in the art. But as Pablo Picasso sits there next to his painting, if you choose a wrong letter, you'll see Picasso express his displeasure with your mistakes ... if you make six wrong choices, Picasso will let you know that the game is over.

He is generally considered to have been the most important artist of the 20th-century.")


Traditional Hangman
-----------------------
The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. Words you cannot use include proper nouns such as names, places, and brands. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter or number does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark. The game is over when:

*	The guessing player completes the word, or guesses the whole word correctly
*	The other player completes the diagram:
