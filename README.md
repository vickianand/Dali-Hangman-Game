Hangman game for Popular Art appreciation
============================================

As course project for **ART406A course at IIT Kanpur** under **prof. Shatarupa T. Roy**. Through this fun game we aim to introduce the paintings and art-works of **Salvador Dali** and **Pablo Picasso** to school children. 


The Salvador Dali Hangman Game
-----------------------------------
Salvador Dali will show you one of his paintings or a photograph and you need to guess the word that best describes it (in some cases it may be two words). The answers may include a part of the painting's title, or simply a descriptive word of what you see in the art. But as Salvador Dali sits there next to his painting, if you choose a wrong letter, you'll see Dali express his displeasure with your mistakes ... if you make six wrong choices, Dali will let you know that the game is over.
