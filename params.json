Through this fun game we aim to introduce the paintings and art-works of **Salvador Dali** and **Pablo Picasso** to school children. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Salvador Dali Hangman Game\r\n-----------------------------------\r\nSalvador Dali will show you one of his paintings or a photograph and you need to guess the word that best describes it (in some cases it may be two words). The answers may include a part of the painting's title, or simply a descriptive word of what you see in the art. But as Salvador Dali sits there next to his painting, if you choose a wrong letter, you'll see Dali express his displeasure with your mistakes ... if you make six wrong choices, Dali will let you know that the game is over.\r\n![alt text](https://github.com/vickianand/Dali-Picasso-Hangman-Game/blob/master/Dali-Game/img/arts/have_fun.jpg \"Salvador Dal√≠ was a prominent Spanish surrealist painter born in Figueres, Catalonia, Spain.\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pablo Picasso Hangman Game\r\n-----------------------------------\r\nPablo Picasso will show you one of his paintings or a photograph and you need to guess the word that best describes it (in some cases it may be two words). The answers may include a part of the painting's title, or simply a descriptive word of what you see in the art. But as Pablo Picasso sits there next to his painting, if you choose a wrong letter, you'll see Picasso express his displeasure with your mistakes ... if you make six wrong choices, Picasso will let you know that the game is over.\r\n![alt text](https://github.com/vickianand/Dali-Picasso-Hangman-Game/blob/master/Picasso-Game/img/arts/have_fun.jpg \"Pablo Picasso lived from 1881-1973, and was a Spanish-born painter, sculptor, graphic artist, and ceramist, who worked in France. He is generally considered to have been the most important artist of the 20th-century.\")\r\n\r\n\r\nTraditional Hangman\r\n-----------------------\r\nThe word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. Words you cannot use include proper nouns such as names, places, and brands. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter or number does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark. The game is over when:\r\n*\tThe guessing player completes the word, or guesses the whole word correctly\r\n*\tThe other player completes the diagram.\r\n\r\nAn example game in progress is shown below (the answer is Wikipedia) :\r\n![](https://github.com/vickianand/Dali-Picasso-Hangman-Game/blob/master/Dali-Game/img/taditional_game.png \"An example game in progress; the answer is Wikipedia.\")\r\n\r\n[Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game))\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------------\r\nLicensed under [The MIT License](LICENSE)\r\n\r\n\r\nInspired From\r\n-----------------\r\n[Artosology Hangman game](http://www.artsology.com/salvador-dali-hangman.php)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
